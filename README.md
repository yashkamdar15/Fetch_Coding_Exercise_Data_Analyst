# Fetch_Coding_Exercise_Data_Analyst
My submission for Fetch's coding exercise for the Data Analyst position.

List of Files and their description:
1) Fetch_Assessment_ERD.png contains the image of the ER Diagram made based on the given data schema. I have included the "rewardsReceiptItemList" attribute of the Receipts table as a separate table to show the relationship between the Receipts and Brands tables.
2) SQL Query.pdf contains SQL queries to answer two of the given 6 questions. The new structured relational data model is clean, efficient, and performant to query any new questions the business stakeholders raise.
3) Data Quality Check.ipynb is a Python notebook containing code for checking data quality, such as NULL values, Duplicates, Outliers, etc.
4) Email_to_Business_Leader.pdf contains an email that is understandable to a product or business leader who isnâ€™t familiar with my day-to-day work. And it covers the points mentioned in the assessment's description.

Thank you for going through my work, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding the next steps in the interview process. I am excited to use my analytical and technical abilities to grow and learn at Fetch.
